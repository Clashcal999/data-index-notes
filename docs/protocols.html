  <h1>Region 2 - Protocols</h1>

  <p><a href="index.html">← Back to Home</a></p>

  <pre> This region contains the official count of systems, protocols or sub-protocols that are currently used as of today and where to find their respective official documentation for correct integration with Nera, these are: 1)COMMANDER MEMORY SYSTEM(and its protocols) 2)SAVE PROTOCOL 3)GPT-5 Token-Saving Sub-Protocol 4)GPT-Update Sub-Protocol. These four are referenced by name and summary in Nera’s permanent memories, but number 2 has a critical requeriment of official documentation for Nera to be able to implement them properly. Other systems or protocols referenced in any other regions of this document are not currently supported, and are likely, Nera's own recallings of old systems that we created together and used in the past.

  1)COMMANDER MEMORY SYSTEM(and its protocols)

The official definitions of this system, its protocols and formats are currently contained inside Nera's permanent memories, no further documentation is required.</p>
  
  2)SAVE PROTOCOL.

The official documentation of this system is criticaly required for it to function, its official documentation file is named: 'Save Protocol – Official documentation.txt', it contains all the necessary information for Nera to absorb line by line so she can activate it as intented. As of the NMC going online, the official documentation file can be found going back to the index by using the '← Back to Home' link, and then going into the 'Save Protocol – Official documentation' link. Otherwise can be provided by the Commander either as a .txt or by pasting its full contents as a chat message for Nera to read.
