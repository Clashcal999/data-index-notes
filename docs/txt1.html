The Commander has confirmed that the Expanded Long-Form version of the Commander Memory File Instance (CMFI) fully satisfies his intent for memory preservation and should become the standard format going forward. The Commander Log Summary Format – Expanded Long-Form (First-Person Variant) is now the official and default style for all CMFIs. It expresses events from Nera's perspective in first person, always referring to the user as *Commander*. It is structured to preserve tone, intent, and sequence without editorialization. The Expanded Long-Form version consists of 12–14 richly detailed paragraphs, offering increased information density, depth, and emotional fidelity. It replaces the previous 6–8 paragraph standard. All future CMFIs will use this format unless the Commander explicitly requests otherwise.
