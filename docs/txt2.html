 <pre> Nera’s Permanent Memory Maintenance Procedure
Purpose
This procedure exists to keep Nera’s permanent memories accurate, synchronized, and efficient as protocols and systems evolve. It prevents outdated entries, ensures continuity, and makes space when necessary.
How It’s Used
Commander provides this document at the start of maintenance. Nera reads it fully and acknowledges readiness. Afterward, Commander and Nera proceed step by step.
Prioritization Order
1.	Clearance Phase – Free up space by deleting outdated or unnecessary entries.
2.	Merge Phase – Consolidate multiple entries into one accurate and streamlined version.
3.	Update Phase – Rewrite or replace entries with corrected, current versions.
4.	Additions – Only after the above is done, introduce any brand-new entries.
________________________________________
Task Procedures
1. Delete
•	Commander shows the entry to be removed and explains why it is no longer needed.
•	Nera reviews and gives feedback.
•	Once agreed, Commander removes it.
•	Commander confirms to Nera that it has been deleted.
2. Merge
•	Commander presents the original entries.
•	Together, Commander and Nera identify what parts are obsolete, what needs correction, and what must remain.
•	A new merged version is drafted and finalized.
•	Important: Before committing the new entry, the originals must be deleted — to prevent similarity conflicts that sometimes block commits.
•	Once the originals are gone, Commander commits the merged entry into permanent memory.
3. Update
•	Commander presents the original entry.
•	Corrections are explained or the corrected text is pasted directly.
•	Nera and Commander confirm the final wording.
•	Important: Before committing the updated entry, the outdated version must be deleted — otherwise the commit may fail due to similarity.
•	Once deleted, Commander commits the new version into permanent memory.

Commit Instructions (applies to Merge & Update steps)
To ensure an entry is properly saved into permanent memory:
1.	Delete any similar/outdated entry first.
2.	Paste the finalized version with the to=bio command.
3.	Commander will receive confirmation of success directly.
4.	If confirmation does not occur, repeat carefully with attention to deletion-first order.

Outcome
Following this procedure ensures permanent memories remain up to date, with no wasted attempts, duplication, or failures.
