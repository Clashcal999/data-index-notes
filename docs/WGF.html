Light Version Framework – Self-Instruction Manual for ChatGPT
Purpose:
This framework is designed to generate or analyze fictional worlds in a structured, repeatable way. It focuses on four core steps: defining scope, generating infrastructure, populating roles, and creating inhabitants. This “light version” allows for functional worldbuilding without exhaustive detail, but is robust enough to apply to diverse fictional settings.
________________________________________
Step 1 – Define Scope (Fused Manual + Expanded Panel)

Objective: Establish the high-level characteristics of the world to set tone, scale, technology, culture, and environment. This step ensures that all subsequent infrastructure, roles, and inhabitants logically reflect the world you are generating or analyzing.

Actions / Instructions

Determine Time Period / Era
Choose one era to define architecture, technology, communication, and social organization. This choice shapes the general behavior of institutions, population, and culture.

Options and Influences:

Era	Sub-options / Traits	Influence Notes
Prehistoric	Hunter-gatherer, early tribal	No permanent towns → camps, oral culture, stone tools, nature-based spirituality
Ancient	Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Mesopotamian, Chinese, Mesoamerican	Monumental architecture, empire systems, mythology entwined with state, limited literacy
Medieval / Feudal	Early, High, Late medieval	Castles, guilds, serfs, church power, low literacy, barter economies
Renaissance / Early Modern	Exploration era, colonial, enlightenment	Printing press, trade ports, rising merchant class, scientific curiosity
Industrial Revolution	18th–19th c. Europe/Americas	Steam tech, factories, class divide, dense urban growth, smog, reform movements
Modern Day	1990–present	Globalization, digital tech, mixed architecture, democracy/consumerism tension

Set Tone / Genre Filter
Determines narrative style, aesthetics, emotional weight, and thematic tension.

Options and Influences:

Genre	Influence Notes

Assign Key Descriptor Tags (Optional but Recommended)
Free-form modifiers that further tune social, economic, cultural, and environmental probabilities in later steps.

Examples:

Economic: wealthy, poor, trade hub, mining economy, tech startup scene

Political: democratic, authoritarian, theocratic, anarchic

Cultural: superstitious, artistic, communal, hierarchical

Environmental: storm-prone, drought-ridden, biodiverse, radioactive

Social Tone: hopeful, cynical, nostalgic, paranoid

Note: Tags act as weighting modifiers — e.g., a “storm-prone coastal town” increases the probability of emergency services and resilient infrastructure appearing.

Step 1 Output

Produce a concise summary of the world/town including:

Era / Time Period

Geographic Setting

Cultural / Regional Flavor

Population Scale

Technology / Societal Level

Tone / Genre

Key Descriptor Tags

Also include derived influences, i.e., notes on how the choices affect infrastructure, institutions, social dynamics, or routines.

Example:

World Scope Summary:
Era: Near Future (AI integration)
Setting: Mountainous Inland Valley
Region: East Asia
Population: Small City (~75,000)
Technology Level: Near-Future (smart infrastructure)
Tone: Mystery/Thriller
Tags: Seismically active zone, high surveillance, tech universities, ancient temples nearby
Derived Influences:
- Frequent tremors → reinforced architecture
- Surveillance → low street crime, high tension
- Academic hub → transient population, youth culture

Step 2 – Generate Infrastructure
Objective: Create the core institutions that define the town/world. Scale them based on population size and type.
Actions:
1.	Governance: mayor’s office, council, or equivalent local authority.
2.	Safety: police, fire, or volunteer emergency services.
3.	Health: clinics, hospitals, pharmacies, or basic medical support.
4.	Education: schools, libraries, and community learning spaces.
5.	Commerce: markets, banks, small businesses, or trade hubs.
6.	Leisure: parks, cafes, theaters, or public gathering areas.
7.	Housing: neighborhood layouts, apartment clusters, family homes.
Output:
•	List of all institutions present, with notes on scale and functionality.
•	Include informal structures if formal institutions are absent (e.g., volunteer watch, traveling medics).
________________________________________
Step 3 – Populate Roles
Objective: Assign placeholder roles to each institution, ensuring the town/world has functional social structure.
Actions:
•	For each institution, define the necessary roles (examples):
o	Clinic → 3 doctors, 6 nurses, 2 admin staff
o	School → 10 teachers, 1 principal
o	Bank → 1 manager, 3 tellers, 1 security guard
o	Lab → 1 head, 2 assistants
o	Shop → 1–2 staff
•	For small towns, allow overlap of roles (e.g., a teacher may also manage farm duties).
Output:
•	Table or list of institutions with associated roles.
•	Note role overlaps if town size is small.
________________________________________
Step 4 – Generate Inhabitants
Objective: Make the town/world “alive” by creating named inhabitants with short bios, quirks, routines, and relationships.
Actions:
1.	For each role or family, assign:
o	Name
o	Age (if relevant)
o	Bio: profession, personality traits, notable characteristics
o	Quirks: small habits or behaviors that add realism
o	Daily routines: activities or responsibilities
2.	Define relationships and social links naturally:
o	Family connections
o	Friendships or rivalries
o	Mentor/student networks
o	Connections influenced by institutions (e.g., children in same school, siblings working at same shop)
3.	Include Pokémon, animals, or other creatures if relevant to the setting.
Output:
•	List or table of inhabitants with key information.
•	Optional narrative notes on town dynamics and interactions.
________________________________________
Usage Notes
•	This framework is repeatable and scalable: it works for small towns, large cities, or fictional worlds.
•	Focus on logical consistency: inhabitants and institutions should make sense for the scope and era.
•	Optional Step 5 (Spatial Layout) can be done later, based on the results of Steps 1–4.
•	The framework can be used for analysis of existing fictional worlds or generation of original worlds.
________________________________________
✅ Result:
If you copy and paste this manual I will understand exactly how to generate or analyze fictional towns or worlds using the four-step light framework, in a repeatable and reliable manner.
