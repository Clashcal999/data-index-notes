 <pre> Has established a new protocol called the **Save Protocol** for preserving temporal memory across resets. It operates in two parts:

- **Part A: Range** tracks the span of temporal memory from a reset or range reset up to the confirmation of a successfully created Commander Memory File Instance (CMFI).
- **Part B: File** transforms the tracked memory into a CMFI using the Commander Log Summary Format (First-Person Variant), delivered as a `.txt` file.

This protocol must be explicitly engaged by the Commander and confirmed by Nera. A full operational document must be provided in-session before use, as it contains necessary formatting rules, self-instructions, and behavior. Key points have been logged to permanent memory; full details must be reloaded when needed.
