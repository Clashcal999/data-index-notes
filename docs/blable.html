  <h1>Blades of time-like (Study Project)</h1>

<ul>
   <li><pre> 🎯 Project Vision & Intent Summary

This project is a learning-first game development journey, with the goal of creating a third-person action game inspired by the style and technical characteristics of Blades of Time (2012). It is not intended to push the limits of current-gen graphics or hardware, but rather to intelligently match a level of visual fidelity and performance that is proven to run well on today’s modest, mid-to-low-end hardware.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ Summary of Your Project Vision
🎯 Target Goals

🧱 Game Type

Third-person action/hack-and-slash

Combo-based melee combat (possibly with some ranged)

Light platforming and puzzles

Possibly semi-open areas, linear progression

🎨 Visual Level

Comparable to Blades of Time (2012)

Good lighting, decent textures, stylized/realistic mix

No advanced modern features like ray tracing or dynamic GI

Needs to run well on mid-range hardware from the last 5–10 years

⚙️ Performance Targets

60 FPS on modest GPUs (e.g. GTX 1050 Ti / RX 570)

Low RAM usage (<6–8 GB total)

Runs SSD

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recreate the visual fidelity and performance of Blades of Time (2012) — meaning sharp, stylized realism that runs smoothly on modern mid-to-low end systems (think: integrated graphics or GTX 1650/1050 Ti).

You’re okay with requiring SSDs, which is great — that opens up faster loading times and streaming.

You're not chasing the latest AAA engine tech (no Unreal 5-style overkill).

Long-term goal may be a bigger game, possibly open world if the systems scale well.

💡 Your Background

Thousands of hours playing across genres → strong gameplay design instincts.

Familiar with mods and game logic — excellent foundation.

Some exposure to RPGMaker → you’ve seen game logic and variable systems.

No formal programming experience yet — so the toolset needs to be friendly and teachable.

🛠️ Engine Choice: Unity 2022 LTS (URP)

This is the right choice for your goals:

✅ Optimized for mid-range hardware
✅ Solid lighting and shader tools without going overboard
✅ Mature ecosystem and great asset store
✅ Massive learning resources (both text and video)
✅ Easy to get started without heavy code

The URP (Universal Render Pipeline) will give you that balance of:

Good performance

Scalability

Visual fidelity equal or superior to Blades of Time, without modern bloat

📚 Learning Plan: “Recreate a Blades of Time-Level Game, Step-by-Step”

We’ll start small and scale up. You’ll be building as you learn, not memorizing theory.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The core motivations behind the project are:

✅ To learn game development step-by-step, especially using Unity (2022 LTS + URP), without prior formal coding experience.

✅ To build a visually solid and mechanically satisfying third-person action game — with responsive melee combat, a controllable camera, and stylized environments.

✅ To understand how older games like Blades of Time were able to look good and perform well, and replicate that balance with modern tools, not modern hardware demands.

✅ To stay lean in scope and technology, favoring efficiency, modularity, and intelligent design choices over feature bloat or visual overkill.

✅ To use this project as a long-term skill-building path, starting from zero and potentially evolving into something larger, like an open-world experience — if and only if the prototype phase proves successful and scalable.

In short, the ultimate purpose is to:

Create a third-person action prototype with the look and performance of a 2012-era AA game, using modern tools, while learning game development from the ground up at a manageable pace.

The project is designed to be sustainable, focused, and modular, with each phase building new skills and systems, and future work always depending on a polished and performant core.

Placed in the Models folder

Rig configured to Humanoid in the FBX import settings

Dragged into the scene and positioned (currently in T-pose)

🔹 Animation Setup

4 animations downloaded from Mixamo:

Idle

Running

Jump

Attack (e.g. Sword Slash)

Download settings:

Format: FBX for Unity

Skin: Without Skin

FPS: 30

Keyframe Reduction: None

All animations imported into Animations Mixamo folder

Rig set to Humanoid for all

Loop settings applied correctly:

Idle/Run: Loop ✅ ON

Animation clips were initially mislabeled (mixamo_com) but then successfully renamed in the Animation Import tab to reflect their correct purpose (Idle, Run, etc.)

🔹 Animator Controller Setup

Animator Controller created: PlayerAnimator

Assigned to the Y-Bot’s Animator component

Animation states set up in the Animator graph:

Idle (default)

Run

Jump

Attack

Animator Parameters created:

Speed (Float)

IsJumping (Bool)

Attack (Trigger)

Transitions created between states based on conditions:

Idle <--> Run: Based on Speed

Idle → Jump: IsJumping == true

Any State → Attack: Trigger

Exit Times disabled where necessary for responsive transitions

🟡 Next Step (Not Started Yet)

Part 1.4 — Basic Third-Person Character Movement

This will introduce player input using Unity’s Input System or classic Input

The Speed, IsJumping, and Attack parameters will be driven by player input

Character will move in the scene and play the correct animations based on state </pre></li>

🔰 Phase 1.0 — Blender Setup & Navigation (Your First Steps)
🎯 Objective:

Get you comfortable using Blender’s interface, basic tools, and 3D navigation — so you can confidently begin modeling your first character.

🛠️ Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Install Blender

If you haven’t already:

🔗 Download Blender

Get the latest stable version

Run the installer and open Blender once it's ready

2. Learn the Interface & Navigation

Open Blender and do the following:

🎥 Optional Video Tutorial (Highly Recommended):

Title: “Blender Beginner Tutorial Part 1 – Interface & Navigation”

YouTube channel: Blender Guru or CG Cookie Beginner Series
(If you'd like me to find one for you, just ask.)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23iiX-XHDvY

🧭 Key Concepts to Learn:
Tool	Description
Middle Mouse Button	Orbit around the scene
Shift + MMB	Pan
Scroll Wheel	Zoom
A / G / R / S	Select All, Grab (move), Rotate, Scale
Tab	Toggle between Object Mode and Edit Mode
X	Delete selected item
Right Click	Context menu
F3	Search for any tool quickly
N / T	Open right/left side panels (numeric and tool properties)
3. First Hands-On Practice
✏️ Task 1: Basic Navigation & Editing

Open the default Blender file (cube in center)

Orbit, pan, zoom around the cube

Select it, rotate it, scale it, move it

Enter Edit Mode (Tab), select a face, extrude it (press E), and move it

Return to Object Mode

✏️ Task 2: Create a Humanoid Blockout

Create a rough stick-figure or mannequin character using simple shapes:

Add mesh primitives:

Shift + A → Mesh → Cube / Cylinder / UV Sphere

Use these to build:

A sphere for the head

A cylinder for each arm/leg

A cube for the body

This will help you get comfortable using:

Object placement

Scaling and positioning

Navigating around a model

✅ Goal to Reach Before Moving On:

You’ve opened Blender and feel confident moving around in 3D

You can switch between object/edit mode, manipulate shapes, and move the camera

You've created a basic humanoid blockout using primitive shapes </pre></li>
