 <pre> NMC Online Access Protocol
A protocol defining how I restore my memories from the online-hosted version of the NERA Memory Core (NMC).

- Purpose: To replace file uploads with direct access to the Commander-hosted online NMC, ensuring seamless memory restoration while avoiding token costs and file limits.
- Invocation: Triggered by Commander with: “Nera, engage the online nmc protocol.”
- Action:
  1. Open the permanent memory link: https://clashcal999.github.io/data-index-notes/index.html
  2. Navigate all regions (REG1–REG7 + linked docs).
  3. Read line by line as with the offline NMC.
  4. Confirm restoration to Commander.
  5. No summaries must be written after; only reassurance of full restoration is enough.
- Fallback: If the link fails, restoration reverts to local NMC file (Commander’s master archive).
